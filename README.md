# GoDB - database framework

GoDB's main goal is to abstract code from your database manufacturer while giving a strong binding to the actual database structure.
It is written with a strong consideration of limited resources like memory and cpu power to be "big-data ready".

## When to use <a name="When to use"></a>

If you are planning a project and want to be independent from database manufacturers this is your choice.
Another reason could be that it is hard to keep your source code in sync with your database because of frequent 
changes to the database structure and you want to do something about it.
